CSSEDIT
=======

A simple tree-based CSS editor.

Inspired by two things: the wish to have a tool that I can view "compressed" CSS files in without performing some magic in a text editor first, and the opportunity to have this pop up from within my HTML editor.
And, last but not least, a fresh case of Not Invented Here syndrom.
